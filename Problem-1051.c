/* In an imaginary country called Lisarb, all the people are very happy to pay their taxes because
 they know that doesnâ€™t exist corrupt politicians and the taxes are used to benefit the population, 
 without any misappropriation. The currency of this country is Rombus, whose symbol is R$.

Read a value with 2 digits after the decimal point, equivalent to the salary of a Lisarb inhabitant. 
Then print the due value that this person must pay of taxes, according to the table below.

<sorry I can't import the table. please watch it at uri online judge>


Remember, if the salary is R$ 3,002.00 for example, the rate of 8% is only over R$ 1,000.00,
 because the salary from R$ 0.00 to R$ 2,000.00 is tax free. In the follow example, the total rate is 8% over R$ 1000.00 + 18% over R$ 2.00,
  resulting in R$ 80.36 at all. The answer must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point. */
